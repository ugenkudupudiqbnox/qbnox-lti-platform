## Why This Exists

Educational infrastructure should not be opaque, fragile, or locked behind proprietary systems.

Pressbooks is open. LTI is open. Yet critical integrations are often **closed, expensive, or uninspectable**.

This project exists to:

- Give universities **full ownership** of their learning infrastructure
- Provide a **transparent, auditable LTI Advantage implementation**
- Enable long‑term sustainability beyond vendor contracts
- Raise the security baseline for OER platforms

This is not a demo. It is not a plugin experiment. It is **infrastructure**.

Open by default. Secure by design. Governed in the open.
