## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Grades Not Showing

**Issue:** Student completed H5P but grade doesn't appear in Moodle

**Solutions:**
1. ✅ Check if student accessed via LTI launch (not direct URL)
2. ✅ Verify H5P Results grading is enabled for chapter
3. ✅ Check if activity is graded in Moodle settings
4. ✅ Use "Sync Existing Grades" if retroactive

### Wrong Gradebook Column

**Issue:** Grades going to wrong activity

**Solution:**
- Have student launch chapter again from Moodle
- System will update lineitem association
- Future grades will go to correct column

### Student Can't Access

**Issue:** Student gets error when launching

**Solutions:**
1. ✅ Verify activity is published in Moodle
2. ✅ Check student is enrolled in course
3. ✅ Confirm Pressbooks is accessible via HTTPS
4. ✅ Check browser console for errors (F12)

### Multiple Users with Same Name

**Issue:** Multiple "John Smith" accounts created

**Solution:**
- This shouldn't happen - system uses LTI user ID
- If it does, contact administrator
- Old accounts can be merged/deleted

## 📱 Best Practices

### Adding Content

✅ **DO:**
- Use Deep Linking to select specific chapters
- Add chapters as separate activities for granular grading
- Set clear activity names (e.g., "Chapter 1: Introduction")

❌ **DON'T:**
- Link to entire book if you only need some chapters
- Create multiple activities pointing to same chapter
- Forget to enable grading if you want grade tracking

### Grading Configuration

✅ **DO:**
- Configure grading before students start work
- Set weights that total 100% (or use Weighted Average)
- Use "Sync Existing Grades" for historical data
- Test with a test student account first

❌ **DON'T:**
- Change grading scheme after students complete work
- Use too many H5P activities (5-10 max per chapter)
- Forget to save chapter after configuring grading

### Grade Management

✅ **DO:**
- Check gradebook regularly to verify sync
- Use Moodle's grade history for audit trail
- Communicate grading policy to students
- Export grades before semester ends

❌ **DON'T:**
- Manually override synced grades (will be overwritten)
- Delete Moodle activities with existing student data
- Ignore sync errors (check logs if grades missing)
