# Pressbooks LTI Platform - User Guide

**For Moodle Administrators and Instructors**

This guide explains how to integrate Pressbooks with your existing Moodle installation using LTI 1.3.

---

## What is LTI?

**Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI)** is a standard that allows external learning tools (like Pressbooks) to integrate seamlessly with Learning Management Systems (like Moodle).

### Benefits
- ✅ Single sign-on (students don't need separate accounts)
- ✅ Automatic grade synchronization
- ✅ Embed Pressbooks content directly in Moodle courses
- ✅ Track student progress
- ✅ Seamless user experience

---

## Prerequisites

### Required
- Moodle 4.1 or higher
- Pressbooks installation with LTI plugin activated
- Admin access to both systems
- HTTPS enabled on both systems

### Access Needed
- **Moodle**: Site Administrator role
- **Pressbooks**: Network Administrator role

---

## 🛑 Critical: Browser & Privacy Settings

Since LTI 1.3 launches occur within an iframe (Pressbooks nested inside Moodle), modern browser privacy protections can block the integration.

### cookie Requirements
- **SameSite=None; Secure**: Your servers MUST be running over **HTTPS**.
- **Third-Party Cookies**: Instructors and students using Chrome or Safari may need to allow "Third-party cookies" for the Moodle domain, or use a browser that hasn't yet fully deprecated third-party cookies for LTI purposes.
- **Incognito Mode**: Launches frequently fail in Incognito/Private mode as browsers aggressively block cross-site cookies in this state.

## Step 3: Add Pressbooks Content to Moodle Course

### 3.1 As an Instructor

1. Log in to Moodle as **Teacher/Instructor**
2. Navigate to your course
3. Click **Turn editing on** (top right)

### 3.2 Add External Tool Activity

1. In any section, click **+ Add an activity or resource**
2. Select **External tool** from the list
3. Click **Add**

### 3.3 Configure Activity

| Setting | Value | Notes |

2. Click on the Pressbooks activity you created
3. **Expected behavior**:
   - Redirect to Pressbooks
   - Automatic login (no credentials needed)
   - Content displays
   - Student can interact with content

### 4.2 Verify Single Sign-On

Students should **not** be prompted for login credentials. If they are:
- ❌ Check platform registration in Pressbooks
- ❌ Verify HTTPS is enabled on both systems
- ❌ Review browser console for errors

### 4.3 Test Grade Passback (Optional)

If you configured grade passback:
1. Student completes activity in Pressbooks

5. Select book/chapter
6. Content is automatically configured

### Benefits
- Browse available content before adding
- Direct link to specific chapters
- Easier for instructors
- Better student experience

---

## Managing Students and Grades

### Automatic User Provisioning

When a student launches a Pressbooks activity:
1. Moodle sends student information to Pressbooks
2. Pressbooks automatically creates user account (if needed)
3. Student is logged in automatically
4. Role is assigned based on Moodle role

### Grade Synchronization

If grade passback is enabled:
1. Student completes activity in Pressbooks
2. Pressbooks sends grade to Moodle via LTI AGS
3. Grade appears in Moodle gradebook
4. Instructor can view/override grade in Moodle

### Privacy

- Student data is transmitted securely (HTTPS + JWT)
- Only necessary information is shared
- Complies with FERPA/GDPR requirements
- Students can request data deletion

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Invalid request" error when launching

**Possible causes:**
- Client ID mismatch
- Platform not registered correctly

**Solutions:**
1. Verify Client ID matches in both systems
2. Check platform registration in Pressbooks
3. Ensure HTTPS is enabled

### Problem: Students see login page instead of auto-login

**Cause:** Single sign-on not working

**Solutions:**
1. Verify Issuer URL matches exactly
2. Check JWT validation is working
3. Review browser console for errors
4. Test JWKS endpoint accessibility:
   ```
   curl https://your-pressbooks-domain.com/wp-json/pb-lti/v1/keyset
   ```

### Problem: Grades not appearing in Moodle

**Cause:** Grade passback not configured

**Solutions:**
1. Verify AGS is enabled in tool configuration
2. Check "Accept grades" is checked in activity
3. Verify Pressbooks has permission to post grades
4. Review Pressbooks logs for grade posting errors

### Problem: Content not loading / blank page

**Possible causes:**
- CORS issues
- Mixed content (HTTP/HTTPS)
- Firewall blocking

**Solutions:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify both systems use HTTPS
3. Check server firewall settings
4. Test direct access to Pressbooks

### Problem: Signature Validation Fails / JWT Errors

**Cause:** Server time drift or incorrect keys.

**Solutions:**
1. **Sync Server Time**: Ensure both Moodle and Pressbooks servers have synchronized time via **NTP**. LTI 1.3 JWT signatures will fail if the server clocks are off by more than 60 seconds (prevents replay attacks).
2. **Verify Public Keys**: Use `curl` to verify that the Pressbooks `keyset` endpoint is reachable from the Moodle server.
3. **Check Client ID**: Ensure the Client ID in Pressbooks matches exactly what was generated by Moodle.

### Getting Debug Information

1. **Check Moodle logs:**
   - Site administration → Reports → Logs
   - Filter by: External tool activities

2. **Check Pressbooks logs:**
   - Contact Pressbooks administrator
   - Request LTI launch logs

3. **Browser Console:**
   - Press F12 in browser
   - Check Console tab for errors
   - Check Network tab for failed requests
