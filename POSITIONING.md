# Project Positioning

## Foundation Model (Primary)
- MIT‑licensed core
- Open governance
- Community‑driven roadmap
- Ideal for universities and public institutions

## Dual‑License / Commercial Option (Optional)
- Hosted or managed offering
- SLA, enterprise support
- Custom features & integrations

The open‑source core remains fully functional and independent.

This mirrors successful models used by Moodle, Red Hat, and HashiCorp (early).
