# Why This Project Exists

Educational infrastructure should not be opaque, fragile, or locked
behind proprietary systems.

Pressbooks is open.
LTI is open.
Yet critical integrations are often **closed, expensive, or uninspectable**.

This project exists to:

- Give universities **full ownership** of their learning infrastructure
- Provide a **transparent, auditable LTI Advantage implementation**
- Enable long‑term sustainability beyond vendor contracts
- Raise the security baseline for OER platforms

This is not a demo.
It is not a plugin experiment.
It is **infrastructure**.

Open by default.
Secure by design.
Governed in the open.
